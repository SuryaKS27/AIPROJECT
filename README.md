# Smartdrive system

**Description**

SMARTDRIVE_YOLOv8 is an advanced AI-driven system designed to enhance road safety by dynamically adjusting vehicle speed based on real-time detection of critical road conditions. Utilizing YOLOv8 object detection, this model identifies specific classes such as Bumpy Roads, Construction Work, Hospital Zones, Obstacles(like Blocked roads, Fallen trees, Potholes, Car, Bike,...), Pedestrians, School Zones, and Stop signs.

Through the use of bounding box coordinates to precisely calculate the distance to each object detected and mathematical computations to estimate speed, the model guarantees timely and appropriate speed adjustments, thereby promoting safer driving environments. The system allows for the input of both images and videos and provides thorough reporting and analysis for better traffic control and speed limit observance.
